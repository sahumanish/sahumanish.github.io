# About Me

I am an Assistant Research Scientist, and affiliate research faculty in the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR)](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/) of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU).  

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary field of computer vision, machine learning, medical image analysis and surgical robotics aiming to create synergistic advancement of collaborative intelligent assistant systems for various healthcare applications.

Previously, I was postdoctoral fellow at LCSR, JHU. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Computer Vision & Remote Sensing department of the Technical University Berlin.

For a comprehensive list of publications, please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OcVBk1MAAAAJ&hl=en).
